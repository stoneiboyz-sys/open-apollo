title: Supported Devices
---

Open Apollo targets all Universal Audio Apollo Thunderbolt interfaces. The driver identifies devices by their internal device type ID and configures channel counts, preamp counts, and features accordingly.

### Column definitions

- **Playback**: Number of playback (output) channels at 48 kHz
- **Record**: Number of record (input) channels at 48 kHz
- **Preamps**: Number of analog preamp inputs with gain/48V/PAD controls
- **HiZ**: Number of preamp channels that support Hi-Z (instrument) input
- **Status**: Whether the model has been tested on Linux with this driver

## What "Verified" means

The Apollo x4 is the primary development and test device. On this model, the following features are confirmed working:

- Full duplex audio (24 playback / 22 record channels)
- All six sample rates (44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4, 192 kHz)
- Preamp gain control (all 4 channels)
- Preamp flags: 48V phantom power, PAD, low cut, phase invert, mic/line switching
- Monitor volume, mute, dim, mono
- DSP mixer routing (all buses)
- ALSA integration with 50+ mixer controls

## What "Needs Testing" means

These models are recognized by the driver and have correct channel count configurations, but have not been tested on actual hardware. They likely work — the Apollo product line shares a common architecture — but may need adjustments to routing tables or feature flags.

## How to help

If you own an Apollo model marked "Needs Testing", your contribution would be extremely valuable. Even basic testing (does the driver load? does ALSA see the device? does audio play?) helps us mark models as verified.

See [How to Contribute](/docs/how-to-contribute) for details, or jump straight to the device capture guides:

- [Device Capture (macOS)](/docs/device-capture-macos) — capture routing data using DTrace
- [Device Capture (Windows)](/docs/device-capture-windows) — capture register snapshots using WinRing0

You can also run the quick probe script on Linux:

```bash
sudo ./tools/contribute/device-probe.sh
```

This reads basic device information and outputs a report you can submit.
