# setup.ps1 — Install WinRing0 for Apollo PCIe register capture on Windows
#
# WinRing0 is an open-source library that provides userspace access to
# PCIe configuration and memory-mapped registers. It installs a small
# kernel-mode driver that bridges userspace requests to hardware.
#
# This script downloads, verifies, and installs WinRing0 so that
# capture.py can read Apollo device registers.
#
# IMPORTANT: Run this script as Administrator.
#
# Usage:
#   Right-click PowerShell -> Run as Administrator
#   .\setup.ps1

#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
