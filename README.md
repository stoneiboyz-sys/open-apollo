# Open Apollo

**Open-source Linux driver for Universal Audio Apollo Thunderbolt interfaces**

Open Apollo brings full Linux support to Universal Audio's Apollo Thunderbolt
audio interfaces. Built through clean-room reverse engineering, this
community-driven project delivers a native kernel driver, userspace mixer
daemon, and mixer control surface — so Apollo owners can use their hardware
on Linux without compromise.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Linux kernel 6.1+ with headers installed
- Thunderbolt 3 or 4 connection
- Python 3.10+ (for mixer daemon)

### Build and Install

```bash
# Check dependencies
./scripts/check-deps.sh

# Build and install
./scripts/install.sh

# Or build manually
cd driver && make
sudo insmod ua_apollo.ko
```

### Start the Mixer Daemon

```bash
cd mixer-engine
python3 ua_mixer_daemon.py -v
```

## Components

| Component | Path | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Driver** | `driver/` | Linux PCIe kernel module (`ua_apollo.ko`) — handles hardware register access, DMA, ALSA integration |
| **Mixer Daemon** | `mixer-engine/` | Userspace daemon (TCP:4710 + WS:4720) — mixer state management, hardware routing, metering |
| **Console UI** | *coming soon* | Electron + React mixer control surface |

## Documentation
